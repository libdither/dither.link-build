<h1 id="what-is-it"><a class="header" href="#what-is-it">What is it?</a></h1>
<p>Dither is a project that aims to decentralize the internet! It is a toolbox of various tools application developers can use to store data, manage accounts, and communicate across the internet in a private manner.</p>
<h2 id="no-but-really-what-is-it"><a class="header" href="#no-but-really-what-is-it">No, but really, What is it?</a></h2>
<p>Dither is a modular application API built on top of <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p">Libp2p</a>. It aims to provide buliding blocks for communication, data storage, account management, consensus and more to replace most online services with a decentralized and private alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="whats-this-about-replacing-the-internet"><a class="header" href="#whats-this-about-replacing-the-internet">What's this about replacing the Internet?</a></h2>
<p>Dither aims to replace most existing apps and services, however, some services are hard to replace without significant disruption because of their existing user and content base. To solve this, Dither will be able to act as a kind of interface with various services, pulling data from multiple sites and presenting it in a standardized way.</p>
<p>It aims to be compatible for extracting data from and interfacing with most existing decentralized and centralized systems such as IPFS, Github, Reddit, Youtube, Sci-Hub, Odysee &amp; Discord.
<em>The aim for Dither is to replace these applications with decentralized alternatives that are unified through their use of a singular, modular protocol.</em></p>
<h2 id="potential-applications"><a class="header" href="#potential-applications">Potential Applications:</a></h2>
<p>Chat/Communication Apps, Video Sharing, Social Media, Comment systems, File Synchronization, Encrypted Backup, Voting systems, Exchanges, Crowdfunding, VCS, Stores, Serverless Games, Remote Machine Control, etc.</p>
<p>The goal of Dither is to be able to recreate any kind of application in a decentralized manner.</p>
<p>See the <a href="applications.html">application document</a> for Work In Progress ideas for various applications.</p>
<h1 id="core-tenets"><a class="header" href="#core-tenets">Core Tenets</a></h1>
<p>All projects need a direction, and these are the ones I've chosen. (As with everything, they are subject to change.)</p>
<p><strong>Dither should be as modular as possible.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There should be no part of Dither that is hard to replace with a different implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dither protocols and formats should be able to interoperate with most other protocols and formats.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One example of this would be allowing someone to pull comments from Reddit / Youtube into <a href="applications/dithca.html">Dithca</a> and hosting them in a decentralized manner.</li>
<li>Another example might be <a href="applications/dithca.html">Dithca</a> storing Reddit credentials and being able to optionally interact with comment threads pulled from centralized websites.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dither should rely on itself as much as possible for every aspect of development and usage.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Code Versioning, Storage, Building, Distribution, and Communication should all run through Dither as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="structure"><a class="header" href="#structure">Structure</a></h1>
<p>Dither is structured in layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network Layer (Provider Agnostic)
<ul>
<li>Handles peer-to-peer connections (NAT Traversal, Muxing, MDNS Discovery).
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://libp2p.io">libp2p.io</a> for an example of the types of features this will have</li>

<li>Consensus Algorithms (<a href="dither/consensus/distance-aware-consensus.html">Distance Aware Consensus</a>)</li>
<li>User Sync &amp; Authentication (<a href="dither/data/user-management.html">User Management</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application Layer
<ul>
<li>Uses some or all of Dither's features to create an application API</li>
<li>There is a list of <a href="applications.html">potential applications</a> for dither and various work-in-progress API definitions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UI Layer
<ul>
<li>This is the actual UI and design portion of applications. It takes the functions provided by the Application Layer and implements them according to the creator's desires.</li>
<li>It is highly recommended to follow Dither's <a href="dither/application-design-philosophy.html">application design philosophy</a> when designing UI apps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="finding-data-links-reverse-hash-lookup"><a class="header" href="#finding-data-links-reverse-hash-lookup">Finding Data Links (Reverse Hash Lookup)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>This solves the problem of having a hash and wanting to find pieces of data that link to that hash. This is super useful for comment systems and the like.</li>
<li>This is a system by which one can find structures that link to a given hash implementing the reverse trait.</li>
<li>If there is some pieces of data that links from or adds useful definitions to a given piece of data, this is the place for it. One example of this in practice might be having a comment thread. Each comment is its own Hashtype that contains the hash of the post or a replying comment. In order for someone who has the post structure to find the comments, they would need find all the pieces of data linking to this piece of data (i.e. a Reverse Hash Lookup)</li>
<li>To implement this system, there will be a partial binary tree represented by a DAG that can be traversed using the data of the target. (i.e. the post structure's hash). Then the tree can be traversed down using consecutive trail searches. Until a list of all known linked hashes is found. These structures must contain a specific trait called a RevHash to be able to be validated onto the distributed tree. The addition of new links to this tree is done through an implementation of Dither Chain Consensus (see the <a href="dither.html#dither-consensus-chains">#Dither Consensus Chains</a> section).</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideas for Dither Consensus</p>
<ul>
<li>IOTA Tangle</li>
<li>Stellar Consensus Protocol</li>
<li>zk-STARKS (for privacy)</li>
<li>Layered on top of Dither Gravity Tree Search for storage</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dither-consensus-chains"><a class="header" href="#dither-consensus-chains">Dither Consensus Chains</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Regular Chains
<ul>
<li>A chain is created just by linking to one or more other Hashtypes (fundamental format of Dither objects)</li>
<li>Regular Chains can be used to represent filesystems, linked data, pretty much anything.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consensus chains are different in that blocks linking to other blocks are weighted by how much they are linked to themselves. (Like the IOTA tangle)</li>
<li>Blocks are added via &quot;active consensus&quot;, where new blocks are broadcast to computers actively participating in consensus and organized / verified using the Stellar Consensus Protocol.
<ul>
<li>This could be used for a comment system where the comments with the most upvotes / interactions are sorted higher in a specific index.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quorum slices in the SC protocol will be made up of social friends or other trusted users. (which can be registered by applications using Dither in specific contexts i.e. close friends in Dither Chat could be designated as part of a core Quorum Slice)</li>
<li>Quorum Slices will be stored in the trusted user configuration</li>
<li>Small “Consensus Chains” can be publicly listed or privately created between specific users with special rules on how blocks are added</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="inspiration"><a class="header" href="#inspiration">Inspiration</a></h2>
<p>It is much inspired by and takes from various projects such as Rust, TOR, Bittorrent, IPFS, IPLD, Stellar, Ethereum, IOTA, Monero, zk-STARKS, and more.</p>
<h1 id="distance-based-routing"><a class="header" href="#distance-based-routing">Distance Based Routing</a></h1>
<p>The goal of Distance Based Routing (DBR) is to obfuscate connections between computers on the Dither network. It works similarly to I2P &amp; TOR, but is vastly improved by taking into account where proxy nodes are, instead of randomly selecting proxy nodes. It also allows for you to choose the trade-off between anonymity and speed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bandwidth Trading</li>
<li>Configurable Routing
<ul>
<li>Network Traversal</li>
<li>Network Searching</li>
<li>Onion Routing</li>
<li>Routing Wormholes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="network-organization"><a class="header" href="#network-organization">Network Organization</a></h2>
<p>The idea behind network organization is to be able to create a network that reflects the real-world positions of the computers. This is so that it is easy to calculate the latency between different locations in the network and to optimise routing paths.</p>

<p>One of the main ideas behind Distance-based routing is to replace conventional IP addresses with a less structural addressing system. Instead of using an IP address to try to get the routing tables of the internet to route your data where you want it, Routing Coordinates allow for a less metadata-intensive way to route packets: instead of consulting extensive routing tables, all nodes have to do is route packets to a nodes closer to the packet's destination routing coordinates. This conveniently allows for keeping your IP address private, allowing for better protection against Denial of Service attacks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are drawbacks. Routing Coordinates are spatial coordinates that represent the <em>latency topology</em> of a network. Because light travels at the speed of light, this latency topology reflects real-world connections between computers and their relative locations in the world. This allows for the unfortunate possibility that with a sufficiently informed attacker, the precise real-world location of a device could be deduced from its routing coordinates. To deal with this Dither uses Onion Routing by default when connecting to any peers not specifically trusted.</p>
<h2 id="onion-routing"><a class="header" href="#onion-routing">Onion Routing</a></h2>
<p>Conventionally, onion routing is an incredibly slow strategy because of how peers are typically selected in the network. However, with Routing Coordinates, peers directly along the path of the packet can be selected to allow for very minimal overhead. (in addition, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05724v3">HORNET</a> protocol will be used for its incredibly efficient symmetric encryption scheme).</p>
<h2 id="bootstrapping"><a class="header" href="#bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</a></h2>
<p>The by which a new node joins the network is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new node first needs to bootstrap off of at least one existing node.</li>
<li>This existing node sends the new node a set of peer <code>Address</code>es selected based on how close they might be to the requesting node (this will represent a ring of nodes roughly a constant distance away from the existing node, this constant distance being the latency between the existing node and the new node).
<ul>
<li>In the case that the existing node has not been bootstrapped, it will notify the requesting node as such, and if the requesting node continues the connection, it will set its own Routing Coordinates to the origin of the coordinate space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assuming the existing node has at least one peer, the connecting node can accomplish the Local Peer Protocol.</li>
<li>The new node takes the set of peer <code>Address</code>es that were received from the existing node and pings them, measuring connection latency to all of them. The new node queries the existing nodes with the closest latencies for their sets of peers, and repeats until a set of nodes has been aquired ordered by their latency from the new node.</li>
<li>The node choses peers for it's &quot;active set&quot;, by default this is a few hundred of its closest nodes.</li>
<li>The new node then uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True-range_multilateration">True-range multilateration</a> on the closest nodes of its active set to calculate its own Routing Coordinate and then broadcasts this routing coordinate to its active set.</li>
<li>This concludes the bootstrapping process and the node can now use its routing coordinate as a temporary address on the network.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conflicting-networks"><a class="header" href="#conflicting-networks">Conflicting Networks</a></h2>
<p>It is possible, (although unlikely) for two or more incompatible latency topologies to be formed in separate places. This can happen relatively easily if, say, two Dither networks formed independently on isolated networks and then these networks connected to each other. A solution to this problem is still in the works, however, this solution will most likely have to be a system that syncronizes itself.</p>
<h2 id="routing-techniques"><a class="header" href="#routing-techniques">Routing Techniques</a></h2>
<p>There are many possible routing techniques that could be built on top of Routing Coordinates, here is a list of some of the default ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default Routing
<ul>
<li>This uses the underlying networking protocol (i.e. Ipv4 or Ipv6) to send data to and from some address.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Traversal Routing
<ul>
<li>A packet using this routing method contains a destination routing coordinate. When a node receives a packet using this routing method, it simply sends the the packet to whatever node in it's active set that is closer to the destination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proxy Routing (i.e. Onion Routing)
<ul>
<li>Multiple nodes in the network are selected to temporarily proxy packets to their destination.</li>
<li>Chains of these proxies can be formed with Onion Routing support to create re-usable network proxies. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Locality Routing
<ul>
<li>This is a method to protect the exact location of a node.</li>
<li>All the nodes within a certain area in the routing coordinate space are instructed to route any packets they receive with a specific ID to a certain node in the space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bandwidth-trading"><a class="header" href="#bandwidth-trading">Bandwidth Trading</a></h2>
<p>Proxying protocols that rely on the goodwill of peers to route packets typically have only a small number of willing peers to route (ex: TOR). This is why protocols like BitTorrent, I2P and IPFS have systems in place that require peers to play fair and contribute back to the network.</p>
<p>To accomplish this behavior for Dither there are some potential solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A node records how much data has been forwarded through itself from each node in it's &quot;active set&quot; and uses nodes that use it the most for traversal. </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="directional-trail-search"><a class="header" href="#directional-trail-search">Directional Trail Search</a></h1>
<p>Allows for a computer to fetch a piece of data from another computer based on the multihash of that piece of data, as long as at least one computer has the data.</p>
<h2 id="general-structure"><a class="header" href="#general-structure">General Structure</a></h2>
<p>Directional Trail Search takes inspiration for how ants find food: scent and pheromone trails. In Dither, these take form as &quot;holes&quot; and &quot;trails&quot;. Holes form when nodes broadcast to nearby nodes (nearby in terms of routing coordinates) that they have the data behind a given hash. Those nearby nodes will then note down the hash and which direction the broadcast came from. Then, when another node wants to find the data of that hash, it will send out many wandering packets [link needed] that will, when encountering a node that has the desired hash, will be routed by that node towards the node that actually has the data that generates the hash.</p>
<p>The other form is &quot;trails&quot;. These form once a wandering packet has finally reached the node with the data it was looking for (the data the matches the hash). This destination node then sends a special traversal packet back to the sending node that tells each node on the way to take note of what direction the traversal packet came from. This forms a kind of trail in the network that other wandering packets can come across and follow to the desired node. This system also creates an effect where the more popular a given piece of data is, the faster a node hosting it will be found.</p>
<p>For data that is not very popular and can't be find found with a reasonable number of wandering packets, a simple DHT can be used to map hashes to route coordinates.</p>
<h2 id="specific-structure"><a class="header" href="#specific-structure">Specific Structure</a></h2>
<p>Every node in Dither will have a binary tree structure that maps hashes to a relative routing direction or a direct peer (TBD).</p>
<h2 id="downsides"><a class="header" href="#downsides">Downsides</a></h2>
<p>While Directional Trail Search is much faster and more efficient than DHTs, it is not as good when considering rare data. With a DHT, as long as there is at least one node hosting the data, it will be found eventually. With DTS, there is no guarantee that a piece of data will be found.</p>
<p>There are multiple potential solutions in order of feasibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a DHT in addition to DTS by default</li>
<li>Figure out how to get DTS to support rare files natively, perhaps by making nodes send out traversal packets pointing to themselves along the network to create artificial paths.</li>
<li>Store routing coordinates / routing areas on the Reverse Hash Lookup.</li>
<li>Implement a Network Coordination feature that tells all nodes in the network to notify a node when they find the requested data. (induces denial of service vector, probably a bad idea)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="reverse-hash-lookup-wip"><a class="header" href="#reverse-hash-lookup-wip">Reverse Hash Lookup (WIP)</a></h1>
<p>Allows for finding what structures link to a given structure.</p>
<p>Example: Someone can find a comment that links to a post, just given the hash of the post.</p>
<h1 id="ideas-to-add"><a class="header" href="#ideas-to-add">IDEAS TO ADD</a></h1>
<p>Keep track of the number of child nodes for each node in the tree so you can merge reverse hash lookup trees easily in a peer-to-peer fashion which means consensus can be less rigourous.</p>
<h2 id="general-structure-1"><a class="header" href="#general-structure-1">General Structure</a></h2>
<p>A binary hash-linked search tree stored in a decentralized fashion with <a href="dither/data/../routing/directional-trail-search.html">DTS</a> that maps a given hash to object that contains that hash. Hashes are agreed upon in a decentralized manner, but direct consensus is assured, and a pubsub system helps speed up consensus for high-activity hashes.</p>
<h2 id="specific-structure-1"><a class="header" href="#specific-structure-1">Specific Structure</a></h2>
<h3 id="tree"><a class="header" href="#tree">Tree</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The goal for this tree is for nodes to contain as little information as possible so that large portions of the tree can be sent at once.</li>
<li>A Binary Tree contains <code>Branch</code>es and <code>Node</code>s. For this structure, each one will be its own self-defining structure. Each node will contain</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Leaf</code> - </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a system by which one can find structures that link to a given hash implementing the reverse trait.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is some pieces of data that links from or adds useful defintions to a given piece of data, this is the place for it. One example of this in practice might be having a comment thread. Each comment is its own Hashstruct that contains the hash of the post or a replying comment. In order for someone who has the post structure to find the comments, they would need find all the pieces of data linking to this piece of data (i.e. a Reverse Hash Lookup)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To implement this system, there will be a partial binary tree represented by a DAG that can be traversed using the data of the target. (i.e. the post structure's hash). Then the tree can be traversed down using consecutive trail searches. Until a list of all known linked hashes is found. These structures must contain a specific trait called a RevHash to be able to be validated onto the distributed tree. The addition of new links to this tree is done through an implementation of Dither Chain Consensus (see the <a href="dither/data/reverse-hash-lookup.html#dither-consensus-chains">#Dither Consensus Chains</a> section).</p>

<p>Dither is a project that aims to decentralize the internet! It is a toolbox of various tools application developers can use to store data, manage accounts, and communicate across the internet in a private manner.</p>
<h2 id="no-but-really-what-is-it-1"><a class="header" href="#no-but-really-what-is-it-1">No, but really, What is it?</a></h2>
<p>Dither is a modular application API built on top of <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p">Libp2p</a>. It aims to provide buliding blocks for communication, data storage, account management, consensus and more to replace most online services with a decentralized and private alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="whats-this-about-replacing-the-internet-1"><a class="header" href="#whats-this-about-replacing-the-internet-1">What's this about replacing the Internet?</a></h2>
<p>Dither aims to replace most existing apps and services, however, some services are hard to replace without significant disruption because of their existing user and content base. To solve this, Dither will be able to act as a kind of interface with various services, pulling data from multiple sites and presenting it in a standardized way.</p>
<p>It aims to be compatible for extracting data from and interfacing with most existing decentralized and centralized systems such as IPFS, Github, Reddit, Youtube, Sci-Hub, Odysee &amp; Discord.
<em>The aim for Dither is to replace these applications with decentralized alternatives that are unified through their use of a singular, modular protocol.</em></p>

<p>All projects need a direction, and these are the ones I've chosen. (As with everything, they are subject to change.)</p>
<p><strong>Dither should be as modular as possible.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There should be no part of Dither that is hard to replace with a different implementation.</li>

<li>One example of this would be allowing someone to pull comments from Reddit / Youtube into <a href="applications/dithca.html">Dithca</a> and hosting them in a decentralized manner.</li>
<li>Another example might be <a href="applications/dithca.html">Dithca</a> storing Reddit credentials and being able to optionally interact with comment threads pulled from centralized websites.</li>

<p>There are two structures that are core to disp: <code>Expr</code>, and <code>Judgement</code>. <code>Expr</code> is an inductive structure that represents all the terms and types of the language. <code>Judgement</code> is the structure that matches <code>Expr</code>s together to create a typing judgement (i.e. saying some term is of some type or <code>a : A</code>). See [[expr]] for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All structures of the language are defined through [[hashtypes]] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All language types are themselves self-defining structures, including the final bytecode file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The language files are not stored as text files, they are instead stored as self-defining structures of groups of commands.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="expressions-in-disp"><a class="header" href="#expressions-in-disp">Expressions in Disp</a></h1>
<p>An expression is an inductive datatype defined roughly as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum Expr {
	Variable,
	Lambda { bind: Binding, expr: Expr },
	Application { func: Expr, func: Expr },
	Type { order: Nat },
	Pi { bind: Binding, bind_type: Expr, expr: Expr },
}
enum Binding {
	None,
	End,
	Branch(Binding, Binding),
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>See how the <code>Binding</code> structure works <a href="disp/./lambda-trees.html">here</a></p>
<p>The schema consists of the structures of the untyped lambda calculus combined with two type constructors <code>Type</code> and <code>Pi</code>. These represent the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/type+of+types">type of all types</a> with universe polymorphism and the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+product+type">dependent product type</a>. </p>
<h1 id="lambda-trees-a-deduplication-friendly-alternative-to-de-brujin-indicies"><a class="header" href="#lambda-trees-a-deduplication-friendly-alternative-to-de-brujin-indicies">Lambda Trees: A deduplication friendly alternative to De Brujin Indicies.</a></h1>
<p>Used in [Disp]</p>
<p>The current most well known way of representing the lambda calculus is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index">De Brujin Indicies</a>.</p>
<p>This is where you have 3 variants of a lambda Term:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Var(Number)</code> - Number represents how many layers of abstraction (lambdas) the variable is away from its intended binding</li>
<li><code>App(Term, ...)</code> - Application is a list of Terms</li>
<li><code>Lambda(Term)</code> - Lambda represents an abstraction point</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of what this might look like for common equations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>λx . x</code> = <code>Lambda(Var(1))</code></li>
<li><code>λx. λy. x</code> = <code>Lambda(Lambda(Var(2)))</code></li>
<li><code>λx. (x (λx . λy . x) (λx . λy . y))</code> = <code>Lambda(App(Var(1), Lambda(Lambda(Var(1))), Lambda(Lambda(Var(2)))))</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For Disp, I have devised an alternative method that doesn't require integers (and thus is not limited by encoding constraints)</p>
<p>Disp has the same 3 variants of Term:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Var</code></li>
<li><code>App(Term, Term)</code></li>
<li><code>Lambda(PointerTree, Term)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to a construct PointerTree:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>None</code></li>
<li><code>End</code></li>
<li><code>Branch(PointerTree, PointerTree)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the pointertree datastructure can be repurposed from the Term datastructure.
<code>(End = Var, None = Lambda(Var, Var), Branch(PointerTree, PointerTree) = App(Term, Term))</code></p>
<p>Common equation examples of this structure might look like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>λx . x</code> = <code>Lambda(Var, Var)</code></li>
<li><code>λx. λy. x</code> = <code>Lambda(Var, Lambda(None, Var))</code></li>
<li><code>λx. (x (λx . λy . y) (λx . λy . x))</code> = <code>Lambda(Branch(Branch(End, None), None), App( App( Var, Lambda(None, Lambda(Var, Var)) ), Lambda(Var, Lambda(None, Var)) )</code>
As opposed to De Brujin indices where the variables &quot;point&quot; to their corresponding lambda abstractions, with Lambda Trees, the lambda terms carry an auxiliary datastructure specifying exactly which Variables should be replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition when it comes to storage and integration with Dither, these lambda expressions are identified by hash which gives a datastructure like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Var</code></li>
<li><code>App(Hash, Hash)</code></li>
<li><code>Lambda(Hash, Hash)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This version of lambda calculus has been implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/libdither/disp">disp repository</a></p>

<h4 id="how-do-we-generate-fast-code"><a class="header" href="#how-do-we-generate-fast-code">How do we generate fast code?</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Currently, Optimizing Compilers generate fast code through intermediate representations and various techniques to figure out what code is needed and what code is not.
<ul>
<li>https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/HowanOptimizingCompilerWorks.html</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These strategies are mostly arbitrary and not easily improvable. A programmer has to go through and figure out which optimizations are worth the compiler computation cost and which aren't. There are an immeasurable number of trade-offs and potential improvements for a given piece of hardware. This calls for a new method to quantify these trade-offs and create a better system.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-do-we-create-fast-algorithms"><a class="header" href="#how-do-we-create-fast-algorithms">How do we create fast algorithms?</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>We typically manually write algorithms we think will run fast and then compare them to other algorithms using benchmarks. However, benchmarks have so many confounding factors that it is difficult to compare two of them and make definitive conclusions.
<ul>
<li>Results may also depend on whether the algorithm is fit for the CPU architecture. The same algorithm may run faster or slower depending on a bazillion different factors such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-TLSBdHe1A">layout</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-model-performance"><a class="header" href="#how-to-model-performance">How To Model Performance</a></h2>
<p>To create efficient code, we must have a model of how that code is run. Typically this model is held in the programmer's mind and is expressed through compiler and algorithm design. Instead of holding it in our forgetful, biased brains, it might be a good idea to have a software-defined model of our hardware so that we can prove that our optimizations and algorithms are actually faster.</p>
<p>Model specifications &amp; options</p>
<ul>
<li>Should take into account modern CPU features such as: pipelining, superscalar execution, out-of-order execution, and branch prediction.</li>
<li>Should be generic enough to model different CPU generations of the same architecture.</li>
<li>Should take into account other hardware qualities such as RAM latency, GPU parallelization options, and any other model-able aspect that could influence performance.</li>
<li>Simple models could be hand-crafted using published characteristics from documents like the <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/#manual_instr_tab">Instruction Tables</a></li>
<li>More sophisticated models could be made for open source CPU architectures by using the logic gate layout of the CPU. (This may be possible for architectures like RISC-V)</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits to this approach include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No more annoying benchmarks</strong> Faster algorithms can be provably faster for a given model.
<ul>
<li>Note: Benchmarks still need to be used to compare different models of a hardware system, however these benchmarks can be much more sophisticated and take into account more confounding factors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Faster optimization adoption</strong> Compilers can substitute old optimizations for faster ones without delay using a public distributed database of optimization.
<ul>
<li>Scenario
<ul>
<li>Bob has a new optimization for a certain pattern of functional expressions.</li>
<li>Bob proves it is faster for a well-trusted model of x86_64 CPUs</li>
<li>Bob broadcasts optimization to everyone</li>
<li>Everyone checks the proof that it is faster</li>
<li>Everyone uses new optimization, programs are faster</li>
</ul>

<p>A document, web page, or static site is kind of like a program with no inputs.</p>
<p>A pdf document typically contains all the things it needs to render a page to the user, but it doesn't contain the rendered data itself. It merely contains data used to render the page, such as text, fonts, images, formatting and so forth. For a static site, this data is in the form of HTML, CSS, and other linked data. Everything is fetched from the server and parsed into a viewable page. Unfortunately, HTML and CSS is not a particularly efficient format and not super generalized, meaning you are limited in the kinds of static experiences you can create. </p>

<ul>
<li>Truthful - Unobjectionably true</li>
<li>False - Unobjectionably false

<li>Opinionated - Content that is not sourced</li>
<li>Minority Opinion</li>
<li>Missing Context</li>

<h2 id="example-1-simple-factual-error"><a class="header" href="#example-1-simple-factual-error">Example 1: Simple Factual Error</a></h2>
<p>In Youtuber Fireship's video &quot;Rust in 100 Seconds&quot; at 0:55 he incorrectly says that mutable values are stored in the heap.</p>
<p>Ideal processes of correction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone realizes that there is an error and creates an <code>Objection</code>
<ul>
<li>Objections come with 3 parts: <code>Selection</code>, <code>Type</code>, <code>Reason</code>, and <code>Evidence</code> </li>
<li>For the <code>Selection</code>, they use the <code>Transcript</code> selection type and select the following lines:
<pre><code>00:55 mutable values or objects with an
00:57 unknown size at compile time are stored
00:59 in the heap memory
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>They set the <a href="applications/protocol-of-truth/./protocol-types.html"><code>Type</code></a> to <code>Error</code>.</li>
<li>For the <code>Reason</code> they say:</li>
<li>
<pre><code>&quot;While objects with unknown size at compile time are typically stored in the heap, mutable objects can be stored on the stack OR the heap.&quot;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>They do not give any <code>Evidence</code> as this is common knowledge in rust.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As people come to the video, they see the label on the video as <code>Pending - Potential Error</code> and click to see the <code>Objection</code> to do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Mark the <code>Objection</code> as <code>True</code></li>
<li>Mark the <code>Objection</code> as <code>False</code></li>
<li>Flag the <code>Objection</code> as <code>Incomplete</code></li>
<li>Flag the <code>Objection</code> as <code>Unknown</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When flagging an Objection, you must have at least 10 karma and a verified human account. If you mark an objection as True while the statement is resolved as false or vice versa, you will loose 5 truth karma. If marked correctly you will gain 1 truth karma.</li>
<li>Confident people may also stake 100, 1000, or 10,000 karma to add 2, 3, or 4 votes respectively. (You will also loose half of your staked karma if you mark incorrectly, although you will gain more points if guessed correctly).</li>
<li>People may also stake their karma (max 10) on a resolution for increased karma return when the Objection comes to consensus in their favor. that they agree or that they are completely confident with the <code>Objection</code> (beause it is obvious). Or they comment under the objection with </li>
<li>If after a substantial period of time there is a 4/5th majority either way (True or False or Unknown), the objection will be marked true or false, which will change the label of the video. If there is no super consensus, it is marked as controversial. Controversial resolutions will only effect the video label for certain <code>Objection</code> types.</li>
<li>Ideally, the creator sees the <code>Objection</code> and the supporting &quot;True&quot; marks from the community, admits that they make an error and personally mark the <code>Objection</code> as True so that the community knows that the <code>Objection</code> has been acknowledged by the original creator.
<ul>
<li>In this case, Fireship could create a patch to that part of the video in response to the <code>Objection</code> and link to the original Objection to revert the &quot;small error&quot; label.</li>

<h1 id="why-copyright-is-cancer"><a class="header" href="#why-copyright-is-cancer">Why Copyright is Cancer</a></h1>
<p>Copyright is ineffective in the internet age. Any piece of content can be pirated on a massive scale without the original creator even knowing. The only thing copyright does is suppress derivative creation on forums with strict copyright adherence. See these videos on why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jwo5qc78QU">the current copyright system is broken</a> and why it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVkeJI2feyQ">makes no sense</a>. This document outlines an alternate system of funding creation that Dither aims to create.</p>
<p><strong>Have a decentralized &amp; democratized forum of communication and publication that no institution or individual can meaningfully obstruct.</strong> Dither is a protocol for creating decentralized applications.</p>
<p><strong>Provide a direct connection of support between the consumers and the creators allowing people to directly support creators for the content they produce</strong> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnnYCJNhw7w">Paying for Production, not Distribution</a>). Even huge projects like Marvel movies or video games can be supported through community fundraising. Each production raises the reputation of the artist(s), allowing them to raise more money from their fans for the next project.</p>
<p><strong>Preventing artists from having control over their art allows all artists to use and adapt and <em>recreate</em> the work of other artists</strong>. Imagine all the games and movies that were super hyped up but totally flopped. If anyone was allowed to make anyone else's work but better, artists have an incentive to make good stories so that they can raise money for their next project, instead of making something crappy and making all their money off of preorders. This would also prevent the fragmentation of distribution services as no one entity can have exclusive control over a piece of content.</p>
